- I built MERN stack responsive web application that allows user to register account, and text each other in real time
- Its frontend was made with ReactJS/HTML/CSS, while Chat History and login information was stored in MongoDB, with encrypted passwords for security.
- I used Socket.IO to enable real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.
- I used Frame Motion to create smooth and visually appealing animations and interactions
